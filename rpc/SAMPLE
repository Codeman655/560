TO TEST:

I wrote a program to randomly generate 100000 commands.
> ./unit_test > utests
> ./bankclient utests 

I also wrote some commands which more thoughtfully stress the input validation:
> ./bankclient manual_tests

This script stress-tests the server. It forks 100 instances of bankclient on the output of unit_test, which generates file of 100000 commands, so 10^7 commands will be sent to the server.

> ./stress_test.sh

TO KILL SERVER INSTANCES

> pkill bankserver 

TO KILL ALL CLIENT INSTANCES

> pkill bankclient
